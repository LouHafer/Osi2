/*! \brief OSI2 %API virtual base class

  The general philosophy of the %API hierarchy is that the APIs are defined by
  abstract classes. Concrete implementations derive from the abstract classes.
  
  When used within the OSI2 plugin framework, it is expected that
  instantiations of %API objects will be managed using the ControlAPI
  interface.

  The API class forms the root of the OSI2 %API hierarchy. Its raison d'etre
  is to provide a common pointer for %API objects handled by the
  \link ControlAPI::createObject createObject \endlink and
  \link ControlAPI::destroyObject destroyObject \endlink methods of
  ControlAPI.  It also defines an interface to inquire about the
  APIs supported by an object and a hook where a control %API can record
  information for managing the %API object.

  /*! \brief Copy constructor

    C++ programmers will tend to use clone without thinking about it.
    Semantically, this is a problem because the clone was not created by
    ControlAPI::createObject (or some other control %API) and we cannot
    simply pass on the \link ctrlInfo_ control information \endlink.
    We need this copy constructor to avoid copying the control information
    pointer to the cloned object.

  /*! \name Object API inquiry support

    The following methods provide a way to interrogate an object to find
    out what APIs the object implements and how to access those APIs.

    The "ident" string for an %API should be defined by its XxxAPI class.
    Supporting classes should define a static method
    \code{.cpp}
      char *XxxAPI::getAPIIDString()
    \endcode
    to return the ident string for the %API.

    The capabilities vector returned in \p idents should be a simple array
    of "ident" strings, one for each API supported by this object.

    reply dynamically. A return value of 0 means no %API support information

    If the invoking object inherits from XxxAPI, simply return the invoking
    object; getAPIPtr is simply certifying it can be used as XxxAPI.
    Otherwise, getAPIPtr should return a pointer to an object that can be
    used as an object of class XxxAPI.
